## SUBCOMMANDS:

This plugin provides the following Knife subcommands. Specific command options can be found by invoking the subcommand with a ``--help`` flag

### knife profitbricks server create

Provisions a new server and then perform a Chef bootstrap (using the SSH protocol). The goal of the bootstrap is to get Chef installed
on the target system so it can run Chef Client with a Chef Server.

During provisioning your public SSH key will be uploaded to the newly created server, thus you should make sure a public key exists at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or provide a different key via the `--public-key-file` option.

The following knife-profitbricks options are required:

## EXAMPLE

First you need an existing DataCenter, you can create it via the [DCD](https://my.profitbricks.com/dashboard/dcd/) or just use the profitbricks command which got installed via the [profitbricks](https://github.com/dsander/profitbricks) gem which is a dependency of knife-profitbricks:

    profitbricks data_center create name=demo

You are now set up to create a new server:

    knife profitbricks server create --data-center demo --name test --ram 512 --cpus 1
